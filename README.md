Chrome extension, which replaces *Benedict Cumberbatch* by silly names.

Inspired by this AskReddit thread: [What's your best approximation of Benedict Cumberbatch's name in such a way that doesn't make sense but everyone still knows who you're talking about?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5ccuwq/whats_your_best_approximation_of_benedict/)

Feel free to open pull requests with new names!
