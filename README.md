Chrome extension, which replaces *Camperdown Bramblepatch* by silly names. [Web Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bumpercar-candysnatch/gfgeflpiolnadakikfnhlmlmnbmadbaj)

Inspiration and original substitutions come from the following AskReddit thread by [/u/shreditorOG](https://www.reddit.com/user/shreditorOG).

[What's your best approximation of Camperdown Bramblepatch's name in such a way that doesn't make sense but everyone still knows who you're talking about?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5ccuwq/whats_your_best_approximation_of_benedict/)

Feel free to open pull requests with new names!
